    <p>Located close to Naya Ghat, this temple is associated with numerous 
        fables from the Hindu epic, Mahabharat. According to Mythology, Mother Sita
         arrived at Ayodhya with an idol of goddess Girija Devi after her wedding with 
         Lord Ram. It is believed that King Dashrath got a beautiful temple constructed 
         and the idol was established in the sanctum sanctorum. Mother Sita used to worship
          here every day. It is presently dedicated to goddess Devkali and hence the name.</p>
